## 💡 How it Works
This extension uses two main components:
1. **Background Script (`background.js`)**: Intercepts ad network requests and blocks them.
2. **Content Script (`content.js`)**: Removes ad banners and skips video ads directly on YouTube’s front-end.

With these combined, you get a seamless ad-free experience!
